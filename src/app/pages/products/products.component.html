  <h2 class="section-title">How to Choose the Right Stabilizer</h2>
  <div class="guide-content">
    <div class="guide-item">
      <h3>1. Determine Your Appliance's Power Requirements</h3>
      <p>Check the power rating (in watts or VA) of the appliance you want to protect. This information is usually found on the appliance's nameplate or in the user manual.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="guide-item">
      <h3>2. Consider Voltage Fluctuation Range</h3>
      <p>Assess the typical voltage fluctuations in your area. Areas with severe fluctuations require stabilizers with a wider operating range.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="guide-item">
      <h3>3. Evaluate Additional Features</h3>
      <p>Consider features like time delay protection, high/low voltage cut-off, surge protection, and digital displays based on your specific needs.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="guide-item">
      <h3>4. Account for Future Needs</h3>
      <p>Choose a stabilizer with slightly higher capacity than currently required to accommodate any future upgrades to your appliances.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-items">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why do I need a voltage stabilizer?</h3>
      <p>Voltage stabilizers protect your appliances from damage caused by voltage fluctuations, which can reduce their lifespan and affect performance. They ensure a consistent voltage supply to your devices.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How long do stabilizers typically last?</h3>
      <p>With proper maintenance, a quality voltage stabilizer can last 8-10 years or more, depending on usage conditions and the quality of components.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can one stabilizer protect multiple appliances?</h3>
      <p>Yes, whole-house or multi-appliance stabilizers can protect several devices. However, it's important to ensure the stabilizer's capacity is sufficient for the combined load of all connected appliances.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What's the difference between a stabilizer and a UPS?</h3>
      <p>A stabilizer regulates voltage but doesn't provide backup power during outages. A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) provides both voltage regulation and battery backup during power failures.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do digital appliances need stabilizers?</h3>
      <p>Yes, digital appliances often contain sensitive electronic components that can be damaged by voltage fluctuations. In fact, they may require more precise voltage regulation than older analog devices.</p>
